# CHURN-Project
# Analyze and predict service churn

A start-up sent me a dataset with information on all current and past customers who have subscribed to their services. This dataset contained a boolean variable 'IS_CHURN' with a value of 1 when the customer is still a subscriber and 0 otherwise. 
From this dataframe, I was able to make a classification with 'IS_CHURN' as the explained variable, and as explanatory variables the size of the customer's company, the length of time they've been a subscriber, the number of visits to their site, their conversion rate, the total amount paid for the service and other variables...

Here's what the dataset looks like:
